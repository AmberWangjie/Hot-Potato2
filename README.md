# Hot-Potato2
In this project I developed a pair of programs that model a simple game.
The game is simple, but have given me hands-on practice with creating a multi-process application , processing command line arguments,
Setting up IPC channels between the processes(using UNIX fifos), and reading/writing information between processes across the IPC channels.
